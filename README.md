# PriceIsRight
The contestant is shown five grocery items. The goal of the game is to buy a total of between $20 and $22. To do this, the contestant will choose an item, and how many of that item he/she wants to buy. The price is revealed, multiplied by the quantity of the purchase, which itself is rung up on a cash register. If the total is less than $20, they may choose another item and how much of it, which is added to their total. This continues until he/she has spent over $20 or used up all five grocery items. The player loses by spending over $22 or by spending less than $20 after using all five items. If the contestant succeeds in spending between $20-$22, he/she wins the prize.
